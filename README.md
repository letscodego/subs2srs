subs2srs allows you to create import files for Anki or other Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS) based on your favorite foreign language movies and TV shows to aid in the language learning process. See http://subs2srs.sourceforge.net/ for more information.

I just upgrated .net and TagLibSharp to the new versions.
